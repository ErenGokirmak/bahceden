# Bahçeden

**Bahçeden**, an Android e-commerce app designed to connect small local food producers and customer, was our CS102 project, a team of 5 people. The project was done over the span of 4 months.

## Dependencies

The project used various Java libraries and frameworks. The frontend of the project used *Android Studio* to create an Android application capable of the requirements we had in mind for our project. We also utilized *Retrofit*, a Java library designed for making HTTP API requests to the backend of our application. This backend was implemented using the *Spring Framework*. The backend also utilizes Jsoup, a Java library for manipulating HTML files to scrape product data. To store this data, along with the user data, our application made use of a MySQL database.
